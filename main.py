I am writing to express my interest in the {position} role. With 3.7+ years of professional experience building scalable, secure, and production-ready web applications using Python and Django REST Framework, I bring strong expertise in backend engineering and cloud deployment.

At DreamzTech Solutions, I led backend development for education and analytics platforms used by over 1,000 active users monthly. My work involved implementing role-based access with JWT, integrating third-party APIs like Wonde, and deploying on AWS EC2. Iâ€™ve also worked on report automation with Celery + Redis, and delivered PDF/Excel reporting modules for various domains.

Prior to that, I contributed to IT automation systems at Stackup Technologies and built reusable job orchestration APIs using Django and PostgreSQL. My approach is focused on performance, clean code, and security.

My current CTC is 8.28 LPA, and I am an immediate joiner. Iâ€™m actively seeking my next challenge to build high-impact platforms and collaborate with strong tech teams.

Please find my resume attached. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience aligns with your teamâ€™s goals.
